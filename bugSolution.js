The solution involves configuring Tailwind's purge options to either add the dynamically added classes to a safelist or properly configure the purge to include the elements with those classes.

**Method 1: Using `safelist`**

Add the classes you know will be added dynamically to the `safelist` array in your `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // ...other config
purge: {
    content: ['./index.html', './src/**/*.js'],
    safelist: ['text-red-500', 'bg-blue-500'] // Add your dynamic classes here
  }
}
```

**Method 2:  Adjusting Purge Content**
Ensure that any files or components which may contain these dynamically added classes are included in the `content` array within your `tailwind.config.js` purge options.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // ...other config
purge: {
    content: ['./index.html', './src/**/*.js', './dynamic-styles.js'] //Include all files where dynamic styles might be added 
  }
}
```

Choose the method that best suits your project's structure and dynamic class management.
