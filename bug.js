This error occurs when Tailwind's purge functionality removes styles that are dynamically added to elements after the initial render.  For example, using JavaScript to add classes or change the state of components.  The purged CSS doesn't contain the styles needed for these dynamic changes, resulting in unexpected visual issues.
